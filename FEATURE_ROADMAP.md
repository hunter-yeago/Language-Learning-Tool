Dictionary Notes
The dictionary serves as the Source of Truth for the users information and usage of words.. Everything goes through and attaches to it. As word are used and have a history and all that, you open up your dictionary and its like opening up your own history book of the learning of the language.

That idea of not just having it be a useful app but also to serve as a historical record keeping of the language learning itself is... interesting. history of the use of the word. essays. buckets. there can even be a little graphic, or eonnected html elements. like

well the word in a box like how it is shown in the bucket section on the dahboard. with a line that links to the next one then thats the second, then the third, etc. Maybe there can be a little crown on the top left corner of the word when its finally marked correct.

User Pain Points - LingQ
<!-- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS3kSezOTvY -->
- "It doesn't actually give you the grammatical aspects of a word if you click on it (shown in sidebar)"
For example (in french) If you click on a word that its in the imperfective case, it won't tell you it's imperfective
, it will only give you the english translation.
